# Movies Review - Naive Bayes

##### In this project, we will use text classification on a subset from the rotten tomatoes database with Naive Bayes to predict if a movie is "rotten" or "fresh."


### Results - 
##### The model with the highest accuracy score was our default Naive Bayes, with a 77.8% prediction rate. By tuning the parameters on our classifier we were able to decrease the overfitting on our model, but with a decrease in accuracy score. In addition, we also ran the Random Forest Regression model, but its accuracy score was only 68%.
